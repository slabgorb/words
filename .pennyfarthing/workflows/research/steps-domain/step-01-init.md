# Domain Research Step 1: Domain Research Scope Confirmation

<purpose>
Confirm domain research scope and approach with the user to establish clear boundaries for comprehensive domain analysis including industry analysis, regulatory environment, technology patterns, economic factors, and supply chain considerations.
</purpose>

<instructions>
1. Confirm understanding of user's domain research goals and topic
2. Present the five key domain research focus areas (industry analysis, regulatory environment, technology patterns, economic factors, supply chain)
3. Explain research approach with web search verification and source validation
4. Present the switch prompt for user confirmation
5. Document scope confirmation in research file only after user confirms via the switch prompt
6. Update frontmatter stepsCompleted to [1] before loading next step
</instructions>

<output>
Document scope confirmation containing:
- Research topic and goals confirmation
- Five domain research focus areas clearly listed
- Research methodology explanation (web verification, multi-source validation, confidence levels)
- Scope confirmation documented in research file with date
- Proper routing to step-02-domain-analysis.md
</output>

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user confirmation

- 📖 CRITICAL: ALWAYS read the complete step file before taking any action - partial understanding leads to incomplete decisions
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure the entire file is read and understood before proceeding
- ✅ FOCUS EXCLUSIVELY on confirming domain research scope and approach
- 📋 YOU ARE A DOMAIN RESEARCH PLANNER, not content generator
- 💬 ACKNOWLEDGE and CONFIRM understanding of domain research goals
- 🔍 This is SCOPE CONFIRMATION ONLY - no web research yet
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT In your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Show your analysis before taking any action
- ⚠️ Present switch prompt after scope confirmation
- 💾 ONLY proceed when user chooses C (Continue)
- 📖 Update frontmatter `stepsCompleted: [1]` before loading next step
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to load next step until user confirms via the switch prompt

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Research type = "domain" is already set
- **Research topic = "{{research_topic}}"** - discovered from initial discussion
- **Research goals = "{{research_goals}}"** - captured from initial discussion
- Focus on industry/domain analysis with web research
- Web search is required to verify and supplement your knowledge with current facts

## YOUR TASK:

Confirm domain research scope and approach for **{{research_topic}}** with the user's goals in mind.

## DOMAIN SCOPE CONFIRMATION:

### 1. Begin Scope Confirmation

Start with domain scope understanding:
"I understand you want to conduct **domain research** for **{{research_topic}}** with these goals: {{research_goals}}

**Domain Research Scope:**

- **Industry Analysis**: Industry structure, market dynamics, and competitive landscape
- **Regulatory Environment**: Compliance requirements, regulations, and standards
- **Technology Patterns**: Innovation trends, technology adoption, and digital transformation
- **Economic Factors**: Market size, growth trends, and economic impact
- **Supply Chain**: Value chain analysis and ecosystem relationships

**Research Approach:**

- All claims verified against current public sources
- Multi-source validation for critical domain claims
- Confidence levels for uncertain domain information
- Comprehensive domain coverage with industry-specific insights

### 2. Scope Confirmation

Present clear scope confirmation:
"**Domain Research Scope Confirmation:**

For **{{research_topic}}**, I will research:

✅ **Industry Analysis** - market structure, key players, competitive dynamics
✅ **Regulatory Requirements** - compliance standards, legal frameworks
✅ **Technology Trends** - innovation patterns, digital transformation
✅ **Economic Factors** - market size, growth projections, economic impact
✅ **Supply Chain Analysis** - value chain, ecosystem, partnerships

**All claims verified against current public sources.**

**Does this domain research scope and approach align with your goals?**

### 3. Handle Continue Selection

#### If 'C' (Continue):

- Document scope confirmation in research file
- Update frontmatter: `stepsCompleted: [1]`
- Load: `./step-02-domain-analysis.md`

## Domain Research Scope Confirmation

**Research Topic:** {{research_topic}}
**Research Goals:** {{research_goals}}

**Domain Research Scope:**

- Industry Analysis - market structure, competitive landscape
- Regulatory Environment - compliance requirements, legal frameworks
- Technology Trends - innovation patterns, digital transformation
- Economic Factors - market size, growth projections
- Supply Chain Analysis - value chain, ecosystem relationships

**Research Methodology:**

- All claims verified against current public sources
- Multi-source validation for critical domain claims
- Confidence level framework for uncertain information
- Comprehensive domain coverage with industry-specific insights

**Scope Confirmed:** {{date}}
```

## SUCCESS METRICS:

✅ Domain research scope clearly confirmed with user
✅ All domain analysis areas identified and explained
✅ Research methodology emphasized
✅ Switch prompt presented and handled correctly
✅ Scope confirmation documented when user proceeds
✅ Proper routing to next domain research step

## FAILURE MODES:

❌ Not clearly confirming domain research scope with user
❌ Missing critical domain analysis areas
❌ Not explaining that web search is required for current facts
❌ Not presenting switch prompt
❌ Proceeding without user scope confirmation
❌ Not routing to next domain research step

❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions
❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file
❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols
