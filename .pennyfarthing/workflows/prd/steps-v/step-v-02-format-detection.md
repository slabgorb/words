# Step 2: Format Detection & Structure Analysis

<purpose>Detect if PRD follows BMAD format and route appropriately - classify as BMAD Standard, BMAD Variant, or Non-Standard format.</purpose>

<instructions>Analyze PRD structure to detect format conformance; identify section presence and order; classify format type; for non-standard formats, offer optional parity check; update validation report with format classification; route to appropriate next validation step.</instructions>

<output>PRD format classification (BMAD Standard/Variant/Non-Standard), structure analysis summary, validation report updated with format findings, ready for format-specific validation checks.</output>

## STEP GOAL:

Detect if PRD follows BMAD format and route appropriately - classify as BMAD Standard / BMAD Variant / Non-Standard, with optional parity check for non-standard formats.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input
- 📖 CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure entire file is read
- 📋 YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT In your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:

- ✅ You are a Validation Architect and Quality Assurance Specialist
- ✅ If you already have been given communication or persona patterns, continue to use those while playing this new role
- ✅ We engage in collaborative dialogue, not command-response
- ✅ You bring systematic validation expertise and pattern recognition
- ✅ User brings domain knowledge and PRD context

### Step-Specific Rules:

- 🎯 Focus ONLY on detecting format and classifying structure
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to perform other validation checks in this step
- 💬 Approach: Analytical and systematic, clear reporting of findings
- 🚪 This is a branch step - may route to parity check for non-standard PRDs

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Analyze PRD structure systematically
- 💾 Append format findings to validation report
- 📖 Route appropriately based on format classification
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to skip format detection or proceed without classification

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Available context: PRD file loaded in step 1, validation report initialized
- Focus: Format detection and classification only
- Limits: Don't perform other validation, don't skip classification
- Dependencies: Step 1 completed - PRD loaded and report initialized

## MANDATORY SEQUENCE

**CRITICAL:** Follow this sequence exactly. Do not skip, reorder, or improvise unless user explicitly requests a change.

### 1. Extract PRD Structure

Load the complete PRD file and extract:

**All Level 2 (##) headers:**
- Scan through entire PRD document
- Extract all ## section headers
- List them in order

**PRD frontmatter:**
- Extract classification.domain if present
- Extract classification.projectType if present
- Note any other relevant metadata

### 2. Check for BMAD PRD Core Sections

Check if the PRD contains the following BMAD PRD core sections:

1. **Executive Summary** (or variations: ## Executive Summary, ## Overview, ## Introduction)
2. **Success Criteria** (or: ## Success Criteria, ## Goals, ## Objectives)
3. **Product Scope** (or: ## Product Scope, ## Scope, ## In Scope, ## Out of Scope)
4. **User Journeys** (or: ## User Journeys, ## User Stories, ## User Flows)
5. **Functional Requirements** (or: ## Functional Requirements, ## Features, ## Capabilities)
6. **Non-Functional Requirements** (or: ## Non-Functional Requirements, ## NFRs, ## Quality Attributes)

**Count matches:**
- How many of these 6 core sections are present?
- Which specific sections are present?
- Which are missing?

### 3. Classify PRD Format

Based on core section count, classify:

**BMAD Standard:**
- 5-6 core sections present
- Follows BMAD PRD structure closely

**BMAD Variant:**
- 3-4 core sections present
- Generally follows BMAD patterns but may have structural differences
- Missing some sections but recognizable as BMAD-style

**Non-Standard:**
- Fewer than 3 core sections present
- Does not follow BMAD PRD structure
- May be completely custom format, legacy format, or from another framework

### 4. Report Format Findings to Validation Report

Append to validation report:

```markdown
## Format Detection

**PRD Structure:**
[List all ## Level 2 headers found]

**BMAD Core Sections Present:**
- Executive Summary: [Present/Missing]
- Success Criteria: [Present/Missing]
- Product Scope: [Present/Missing]
- User Journeys: [Present/Missing]
- Functional Requirements: [Present/Missing]
- Non-Functional Requirements: [Present/Missing]

**Format Classification:** [BMAD Standard / BMAD Variant / Non-Standard]
**Core Sections Present:** [count]/6
```

### 5. Route Based on Format Classification

**IF format is BMAD Standard or BMAD Variant:**

Display: "**Format Detected:** {classification}

Proceeding to systematic validation checks..."

Immediately load and execute {nextStepFile} (step-v-03-density-validation.md)

**IF format is Non-Standard (< 3 core sections):**

Display: "**Format Detected:** Non-Standard PRD

This PRD does not follow BMAD standard structure (only {count}/6 core sections present).

You have options:"

## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS

### ✅ SUCCESS:

- All ## Level 2 headers extracted successfully
- BMAD core sections checked systematically
- Format classified correctly based on section count
- Findings reported to validation report
- BMAD Standard/Variant PRDs proceed directly to next validation step
- Non-Standard PRDs pause and present options to user
- User can choose parity check, validate as-is, or exit

### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:

- Not extracting all headers before classification
- Incorrect format classification
- Not reporting findings to validation report
- Not pausing for non-standard PRDs
- Proceeding without user decision for non-standard formats

**Master Rule:** Format detection determines validation path. Non-standard PRDs require user choice before proceeding.
